## 🔄 Recommended Next Steps

### High Priority
- [ ] Deploy frontend to Vercel/Netlify
- [ ] Update frontend API URL to production
- [ ] Test end-to-end integration
- [ ] Set up UptimeRobot or similar monitoring
- [ ] Enable GitHub Actions health checks

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Enable API authentication (REQUIRE_AUTH=true)
- [ ] Create API keys for production use
- [ ] Set up webhook endpoints
- [ ] Configure rate limiting
- [ ] Add error tracking (Sentry)

### Low Priority
- [ ] Custom domain configuration

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### API Endpoints
- [x] GET / - Service info
- [x] GET /health - Health check
- [x] GET /models - List models (167 available)
- [ ] POST /match-model - AI matching (needs image test)
- [ ] POST /upload-model - Upload model (needs auth)
- [ ] POST /rebuild-embeddings - Rebuild AI (needs auth)

### Performance
- [x] Cold start time: ~30-60s (expected for free tier)
- [x] Warm response time: <500ms
- [x] Model list loads successfully
- [ ] AI matching accuracy verified
- [ ] Large file uploads tested

### Security
- [x] HTTPS enabled
- [x] CORS configured
- [ ] Authentication tested (currently disabled)
- [x] S3 credentials secured
- [ ] Rate limiting configured

## 📊 Current Status

### Service Health
```
Status: ✅ Operational
Uptime: 99%+ (free tier with cold starts)
Response Time: <500ms (warm)
Models Available: 167
```

### Known Limitations
1. **Cold Start Delay**: 30-60s after 15min inactivity
2. **Free Tier Hours**: 750 hours/month
3. **Memory**: 512MB RAM
4. **Bandwidth**: 100GB/month

### Workarounds
1. Use keep-alive script or GitHub Actions
2. Show "waking up" message to users
3. Consider upgrade for production traffic

---

## 🚀 Frontend Deployment Steps

### 1. Update API URL
```javascript
// frontend/src/App.jsx
const API = "https://ai-glasses-backend.onrender.com";
```

### 2. Build Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
```

### 3. Deploy to Vercel
```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel deploy
```

### 4. Test Integration
- Upload images
- Verify AI matching works
- Check 3D model loading
- Test all features

---

## 🔐 Security Hardening

### Enable Authentication
```bash
# In Render dashboard, set:
REQUIRE_AUTH=true

# Create API keys:
cd backend
node manage-keys.mjs create "Production App"
```

### Configure Webhooks
```bash
# Add webhook endpoint:
node manage-webhooks.mjs add "https://your-app.com/webhook" "Production"

# Test webhook:
node manage-webhooks.mjs test "https://your-app.com/webhook"
```

### Rate Limiting
Add to `server.mjs`:
```javascript
import rateLimit from "express-rate-limit";

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100 // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
});

app.use(limiter);
```

## 📈 Monitoring Setup

### Option 1: UptimeRobot (Free)
1. Sign up at https://uptimerobot.com/
2. Add monitor for: https://ai-glasses-backend.onrender.com/health
3. Set check interval: 5 minutes
4. Configure email alerts

### Option 2: GitHub Actions (Included)
1. Enable GitHub Actions in repository
2. Workflow runs every 10 minutes
3. Keeps service alive + monitors health
4. Check Actions tab for results

### Option 3: Manual Monitoring
```bash
# Run monitor script
cd backend
node monitor.mjs

# Or keep-alive loop
node keep-alive.mjs --loop
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Guide

### Service Not Responding
1. Check Render dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com/
2. View logs for errors
3. Verify environment variables
4. Try manual redeploy

### AI Matching Fails
1. Check Python dependencies in logs
2. Verify reference_embeddings.pt exists
3. Test S3 access: `python test_s3_access.py`
4. Review match.py for errors

### Models Not Loading
1. Test S3 connection
2. Check CORS configuration
3. Verify signed URLs are valid
4. Check browser console for errors

### Slow Performance
1. Normal for cold starts (free tier)
2. Use keep-alive to prevent spin-down
3. Consider upgrading to paid plan
4. Optimize image sizes
